**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes.
The website emulates a photo sharing application profile, featuring photos of locations around the United States.

**Javascript Features**

The project showcases my newfound JS knowledge. Users can adjust the name and description of the profile, like and delete cards, and even add their own cards.

All popups open with a smooth transition. They can be closed with the X button, by pressing Esc, or by clicking outside of the popup.

Forms are validated, and error messages display dynamically as users type. Submit buttons are disabled when form does not pass validation.
